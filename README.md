# Beer-Pairing App for Food

This program was created to help people find beers that pair with food they currently have in the house or on their grocery list.
By choosing a food, the app will find beers that pair with that food. The beers will also provide descriptions of meals you can create from those foods, giving you not only beer ideas but dinner ideas as well.

With this instant knowledge on hand, you'll soon be creating remarkable beer pairings that excites your normal meal routine and impresses any guest.
