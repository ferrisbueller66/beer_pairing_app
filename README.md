## Summary
This program was created to help people find beers that pair with food they currently have in the house or on their grocery list.

By choosing a food, the app will find beers that pair with that food. The beers will also provide descriptions of meals you can create from those foods, giving you not only beer ideas but dinner ideas as well.

With this instant knowledge on hand, you'll soon be creating remarkable beer pairings that excites your normal meal routine and impresses any guest.

## Dependencies

The following requirements are necessary to run these files:
- Ruby ~>2.7.0
- Open-URI
- json
- Colorize gem
---

### Ruby

This app is written with Ruby and requires Ruby version ~>2.6.1 to be installed on the operating system executing the program.

#### Changing_Versions
If Ruby is installed on your system, verify the currently used version with the command `ruby -v`

You can list all installed Ruby versions on your machine with `rvm list`

Changing the currently used version of Ruby to a version ~>2.7.0 can be achieved with the command `rvm use 2.7.0` (or your specified version).

Running `rvm list` again will confirm that that version is the current

#### Installing_Versions
If you do not have a version of Ruby version  ~>2.7.0 on your machine you, can obtain it by running `rvm install 2.7.0`.

This installation requires `Ruby Version Manager` (RVM). If RVM is not installed on your machine, that can be downloaded and installed with the following command:

`curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`

When RVM is installed, run `rvm reload` or close and reopen your terminal to make sure RVM is fully loaded. Next, install the Ruby version ~>2.6.1 with the subsequent commands:

`rvm install 2.7.0`
`rvm use 2.7.0`

Please see the [Ruby installation instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for further information about installing RVM or a Ruby verion on your machine.


### Open-URI

### JSON
[json Documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.6.3/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html)

### Colorize
Finally, the app uses the [Colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize) gem.

To install, in your terminal, run `gem install colorize`.
